# Running Program

Here's a program I've been using to train for a 10k run and a half marathon.

## Program Modes

There are different program modes, described below in detail.

### Easy

This should be a running pace in which you feel comfortable at any time. You shouldn't be out of breath. Run slowly, so that you always have the feeling that you could "really run a lot faster" if desired.

```
Pace: 5.00-5.30 min/km
```

### Medium

When running an endurance run (ER) medium, you should generally run at a pace that you can still call a "fell-good pace". You're not running slowly anymore, but you feel good. Even at this pace, you should not lose your breath. You should be able to chat with your running partner without problems.

```
Pace: 4.45-5.00 min/km
```

### Tempo Run

During the tempo run, you run faster than your "feel-good pace". However, you should have the impression that you can keep up this pace for a very long time. Your breath should be slightly strained, but regular. Still, you should not breathe too heavily. When running a tempo run, you should not feel like you're in a competition.

```
- 1x 20m warm-up
- 1x 40m run (Pace: 4.30-4.45 min/km)
- 1x 20m cool-down
```

### Interval

Interval training is a game with your pace. The fast running sections are considerably faster than those of the tempo run, the slow ones are relaxed. Interval training is the perfect preparation for a 10k run or a half marathon. Make sure that you adapt the fast running sections to the duration. The fastest pace is at a running interval of 1 min - but do not sprint! The longer the running interval, the slower your pace should be.

During the program, you'll find interval trainings of 1m, 3m and 5m. For example, with the 3m interval, you'll have to run fast during 3m and then you'll have a 3m active break, and so on for a few loops. You should only run really fast in the 1m interval training, not so much in the others, but still at a fast pace.

#### 1m interval

```
- 1x  20m warm-up
- 15x 1m run (Pace: 3.30-4.00 min/km)
      1m active break
- 1x  20m cool-down
```

#### 3m interval

```
- 1x 20m warm-up
- 8x 3m run (Pace: 4.00-4.40 min/km)
     3m active break (sometimes it could be 2m)
- 1x 20m cool-down
```

#### 5m interval

```
- 1x 20m warm-up
- 5x 5m run (Pace: 4.00-4.40 min/km)
     3m active break
- 1x 20m cool-down
```

> Active break: stay in movement, don't sit around, don't stop, keep your body warm.

### Long Distance

The long endurance run (ER) focuses on the length, not on the pace. Start running slowly (in a relaxed ER). Of course, you can slightly increase the pace, so that you reach the pace of the medium ER in the last third of the long ER. But don't run at the pace of your tempo run!

```
Pace (first third): 5.30-5.00 min/km
Pace (second third): 5.10-4.55 min/km
Pace (last third): 4.45-5.00 min/km
```

### Test Race

No matter if it's a city run, a country route or a well-known running path in the forest, you should try to run at a fast pace. But, only run as fast as your fitness level allows you. It is a test run at a fast pace for a long time - hold out until the end! This is also a good time to test your sense of pace. It is best to really push yourself, as based on the result of the test run, so you can determine the best pace for your upcoming race.

```
- 3x 08.50 simulation distance (Pace: 4.20-4.30 min/km)
     3m active break
```
